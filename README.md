📊 Prodigy Infotech Internship – Task 1
Data Visualization using Python
📌 Task Objective

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using a real-world dataset.

📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this task is a demographics dataset containing U.S. county-level population data.

Key Columns:

• State – Categorical variable

• Total Population – Continuous variable

• Male Population

• Female Population

• White Alone

• Black or African American Alone

• Hispanic or Latino

🛠 Tools & Libraries

• Python

• Pandas

• Matplotlib

• Seaborn

📊 Visualizations
1. Bar Chart – Number of Counties per State

This bar chart shows how many counties exist in each U.S. state.

Insights:

• Texas has the highest number of counties.

• Georgia and Virginia follow next.

• Smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island have very few counties.

2. Histogram – Distribution of Total Population

This histogram shows how the population is distributed across counties.

Insights:

• Most counties have smaller populations.

• A few counties have extremely high populations.

• The distribution is right-skewed.
